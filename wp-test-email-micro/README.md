# WP Test Email Micro (VladiMIR+AI)

**Version:** 2026-09__1.34  
**License:** GPL-2.0-or-later

## Purpose

A small administrator-only tool at **Tools → Test Email**. It sends one explicit test message through the WordPress mail transport and reports whether `wp_mail()` accepted it.

## What it does not do

- Does not create or query database tables.
- Does not intercept or retain any outgoing email.
- Does not run on public requests.
- Does not claim successful inbox delivery; it confirms only that WordPress handed the message to its configured mail transport.

## Security and performance

The form requires the `manage_options` capability, a WordPress nonce, validated recipient email, and escaped output. Its only hook adds the Tools page in the administrator area.

The plugin has its own update checker and release package. It does not depend on another VladiMIR+AI plugin for update discovery.

## Replaces

`wp-test-email` v1.1.9 on `detailing-alex.eu`. The replaced plugin creates a `test_email_logs` table and globally records outgoing email, neither of which is needed for an intentional delivery check.

## Installation

1. Copy the `wp-test-email-micro` directory to `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate **WP Test Email Micro**.
3. Open **Tools → Test Email**, enter a controlled recipient address, and send one test.
4. After verification, deactivate and remove the old `wp-test-email` plugin.

For server deployment, use WP-CLI as the website owner and verify both the plugin status and a real received message.
